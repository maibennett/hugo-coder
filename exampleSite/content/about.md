I'm a 5th year **PhD candidate in Economics of Education**, at Teachers College - Columbia University in New York City. My research interests relate to developing and improving **causal inference methodologies** in observational and experimental studies. I also focus on **relevant policy questions in education**, such as socioeconomic segregation and school choice.


**Some of the projects I am currently working on:**

* "How far is too far? Generalization of a regression discontinuity design away from the cutoff" [:arrow_right:](https://www.magdalenabennett.com/research/)
* "Biased Beliefs and the Dynamic Role of Information in College Choice" (*with [Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/)*) [:arrow_right:](https://www.magdalenabennett.com/research/)
* "Impact of the Inclusion Policies on Socioeconomic Segregation in Chile: A differences-in-difference approach."
