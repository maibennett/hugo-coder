I'm a 5th year **PhD candidate in Economics of Education**, at Teachers College - Columbia University in New York City. My research interests relate to developing and improving **causal inference methodologies** in observational and experimental studies. I also focus on **relevant policy questions in education**, such as socioeconomic segregation and school choice.

**I am on the Job Market this Fall**.


**Some of the projects I am currently working on:**

* "How far is too far? Estimation of an Interval for Generalization of a Regression Discontinuity Design Away from the Cutoff" (Job Market Paper) [{{% fontawesome download-solid32 %}}](/files/sub/MBennett_GRD.pdf)
* "Biased Beliefs and the Dynamic Role of Information in College Choice" (*with [Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/)*) [{{% fontawesome download-solid32 %}}](https://www.magdalenabennett.com/abstracts/#chile-rct/)
* "Impact of the Inclusion Policies on Socioeconomic Segregation in Chile: A differences-in-difference approach."
