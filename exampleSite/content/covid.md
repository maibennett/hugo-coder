### What do you do in self-isolation?

I scrape data and do plots! Chile is posting its new cases every day, with the location of where they are tested. So I'm compiling that information, and putting it [here](/files/data_covid.csv) (full repository [here](https://github.com/maibennett/code/tree/master/covid)). Also, doing some maps, because, why not? It's not like there's a dissertation I need to finish...

Update: Ministerio de Salud stopped sharing disaggregated data in 03/18, so Santiago won't be updated. You can still see how Chile is doing, though!
