Here I compile a list of some helpful resources/tips (created by me or others) that have helped me in the past years. Contributions are more than welcome!

##### Python script for ArcGIS to characterize geographic zones with census tract data

Sometimes we need to characterize certain geographic zones (e.g. school districts) with geographic data that is in a different level (e.g. census tract data). How do we do that? **[Here](https://github.com/maibennett/code/tree/master/geographic_characterization)** I have some example code on how to create a csv file using a Python script that can be run in ArcGIS. The idea is that by combining both levels of geographic data, we can later create weights for our areas of interest depending on the overlapping surface of other geographic areas. The code sets an example using Florida school districts and census tracts, and merges tract level income data (you can merge way more census tract data!). The Python code is first run in ArcGIS, and the analysis is later conducted in Stata for simplicity. The example map below shows Collier County School district in FL and the overlapping census tracts:

![collier_county](/images/map_collier_county.png?raw=true)

If we wanted the average household income for the district using the census tract data, we can generate a weighted average of the overlapping census tracts.

##### Stata dofile for LaTeX output

If you are like me, and want to fully personalize everything in your LaTeX output, there's nothing better than creating your own table in a dofile instead of using an out-of-the-can package. You can do it by using `texdoc` and writing your table from scratch using macros. Might sound like more work (it is), but it can also be pretty easy for getting that output just as you wanted. You can download a simple example dofile **[here](/files/texdoc_output.do)**.

##### Need to geocode or reverse geocode?

If you ever needed to go from lat/lon to addresses (or vice versa), then this code might come in handy. The geocode (going from street addresses to latitudes and longitudes) and reverse geocode (the opposite) R script I present here was adapted from the code by **[Kei Saito](https://blog.exploratory.io/reverse-geocoding-part-2-using-google-maps-api-with-r-e676db36fee6)**, and I adapted it to my needs (including geocoding). Be aware that you will need a Google API Key for this (which is easy to get [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)), and you will get charged if you go over the number of requests you are allowed (terms have been changing lately, so keep up to date with that). The code also includes a variable that actually counts how many valid requests you have made, so you can keep that in mind when running this! You can find the code **[here](https://github.com/maibennett/code/tree/master/geocodeAPI)**. 

*PS: You can also easily adapt this code to use Open Street Map (OSM) instead of the Google API, if you want.*

##### Send a text message to your phone when your code is done!

This is some code that [@RichPauloo](https://twitter.com/RichPauloo) created and tweeted about, and you can find [here](https://richpauloo.github.io/2019-09-11-Using-Twilio-to-text-myself-after-long-running-jobs/). If you have ever been running code that takes forever (e.g. a **lot** of simulations), you might have dreamt of something like this. I implemented it as soon as he tweeted about it: It works great, and its super easy to incorporate to your R code. You will have to set up a Twilio account, but it's no fuzz. For changing the emojis, I found useful to install the `emo` package:
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
library(emo)

# Dancer emoji (of course)
dancer <- emo::ji("dancer") 
```
I also randomized different messages you could get, just because I thought it was more fun :)

And voilÃ ! (PS: You will get the ugly "free trial" message ahead of your own customized message, but you can get rid of that by, you know, paying money).

##### How to make a better poster!

Here's a video by **[Mike Morrison](https://twitter.com/mikemorrison)** on why you should build a better scientific poster (and how to do it):

## <a name="apps"></a>Apps

Nothing to do with stats or econ or education, but some apps that are game changers:

* **Copilot Money:** Do you know where your money is going? I thought I did, but.. nope. Copilot helps keep track of your finances, stay on budget, and actually has a daily forecast of how you're doing wrt your monthly budget. And everything is automatic! (It even sends you notifications when one of your credit card debts goes over a %, to keep up your credit score). Truly a game changer (hit me up for an invitation code if you want to skip the waitlist). 

* **Chrome remote desktop:** If you use remote desktop to access another computer or even your own laptop (and you should), you should definitely download the app. You can watch your code run from the comfort of your iPhone (or Android, not judging), and overall it has an awesome interface.

* **Splitwise:** The best way to keep track of shared expenses, either for a trip or if you share a household. It's integrated with Venmo, so you can settle accounts directly from the app.

* **Acorns:** Cool app to save (and invest) some money. If you are a grad student or severely budget constrained (*dat me!*), and have trouble saving money, you can use this app to save round-ups, or even include some small weekly or monthly amount. It then invests your money according to a risk portafolio you select. PS: You can use [my code](https://acorns.com/invite/53JKTQ) to get $5!

* **Strava:** Not much to say here. So far, best tracking app for running.
