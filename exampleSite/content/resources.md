## Resources

Here I compile a list of some helpful resources/tips (created by me or others) that have helped me in the past years. Contributions are more than welcome!

### Code

#### Stata dofile to for LaTeX output

If you are like me, and want to fully personalize everything in your LaTeX output, there's nothing better than creating your own table in a dofile instead of using an out-of-the-can package. You can do it by using `texdoc` and writing your table from scratch using macros. Might sound like more work (it is), but it can also be pretty easy for getting that output just as you wanted. You can download a simple example dofile **[here]**.

### Design

#### How to make a better poster!
